# Group Name: Artistic Reality

### Project Idea: 
Our project will allow users to leave art pieces anywhere in the globe using their phones. 
You will be able to hold up your phone and hang an art work on any blank surface with our programme. 
Art will arise on any blank surface, whether it is a blank sheet of paper, a blank canvas, or a blank wall.
Holding your phone's camera up to that surface will cause your screen to show an art work on that surface.
